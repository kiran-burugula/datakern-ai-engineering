## Python Virtual Environment Setup

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

You will also need a Groq API key to run the scripts. Get a free key at [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) and set it in your terminal:

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```
- **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
  ```cmd
  set GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```
- **On Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  $env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```

### 4. Deactivate

```bash
deactivate
```
